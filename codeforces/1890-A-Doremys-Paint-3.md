## Problem Statement
An array $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of positive integers is good if all the sums of two adjacent elements are equal to the same value. More formally, the array is good if there exists a $k$ such that $b_1 + b_2 = b_2 + b_3 = \ldots = b_{n-1} + b_n = k$.

Doremy has an array $a$ of length $n$. Now Doremy can permute its elements (change their order) however she wants. Determine if she can make the array good.

ExampleNoteIn the first test case, $[8,9]$ and $[9,8]$ are good.

In the second test case, $[1,2,1]$ is good because $a_1+a_2=a_2+a_3=3$.

In the third test case, it can be shown that no permutation is good.
