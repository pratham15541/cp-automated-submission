## Problem Statement
We define an integer to be the most common on a subsegment, if its number of occurrences on that subsegment is larger than the number of occurrences of any other integer in that subsegment. A subsegment of an array is a consecutive segment of elements in the array $a$.

Given an array $a$ of size $n$, and an integer $k$, determine if there exists a non-empty subsegment of $a$ where $k$ is the most common element.

ExampleNoteIn the first test case we need to check if there is a subsegment where the most common element is $4$.

On the subsegment $[2,5]$ the elements are $4, \ 3, \ 4, \ 1$. 

*  $4$ appears $2$ times;
*  $1$ appears $1$ time;
*  $3$ appears $1$ time.This means that $4$ is the most common element on the subsegment $[2, 5]$, so there exists a subsegment where $4$ is the most common element.
