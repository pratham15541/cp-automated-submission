## Problem Statement
A $10 \times 10$ target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring&nbsp;— 1 point, the next ring&nbsp;— 2 points, ..., the center ring&nbsp;— 5 points.

 ![Image](https://espresso.codeforces.com/440826fc807f4a298e765d2288c50226f4ffa740.png) Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

ExampleNoteIn the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is $3 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 = 17$. 

In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is $0$.
