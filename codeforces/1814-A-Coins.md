## Problem Statement
In Berland, there are two types of coins, having denominations of $2$ and $k$ burles.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to represent $n$ burles in coins, i.â€‰e. whether there exist non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ such that $2 \cdot x + k \cdot y = n$.

ExampleNoteIn the first test case, you can take one coin with denomination $2$ and one coin with denomination $k = 3$.

In the second test case, you can take three coins with denomination $2$. Alternatively, you can take six coins with denomination $k = 1$.

In the third test case, there is no way to represent $7$ burles.

In the fourth test case, you can take one coin with denomination $k = 8$.
